This is the code for camera calibration.

The `opencv` library is used to calibrate the camera.

The internal parameter matrix and distortion coefficient of the camera are calculated.

`calibrateCamera` function in `opencv` can calibrate the camera.

Finally, a txt file is generated.

It stores the internal parameter matrix of the camera and the distortion coefficient of the camera
